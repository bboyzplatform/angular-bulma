# angular-bulma

This is a (WIP) project to bring some interaction to the components of Bulma into the Angular world.

The project is in a really early stage and I will implement new components as I need them in my
other projects.

## Installation

Bulma is a dependency of this project so you don't need to install it separately.

### Install with NPM

```sh
npm install --save angular-bulma
```

### Install with Bower

```sh
bower install --save angular-bulma
```

## Setup

### Load the script

Add the `dist/angular-bulma.min.js` to your HTML file.

### Add as dependency

Add `bulma` module as a dependency of your Angular app:

```javascript
angular.module('yourModule', ['bulma']);
```

## Contributing

Again, this is an early stage project, any help is appreciated, feel free to open issues and submit
pull requests.
